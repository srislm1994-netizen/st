Project Goals
Create a Synthetic Dataset:
Generate a time series dataset with at least five interrelated features and clear patterns such as trend, seasonality, and noise. This simulates real-world forecasting data.

Develop Transformer and LSTM Models:
Implement a time series Transformer model with custom positional encoding for sequence awareness, and an LSTM model as a traditional baseline. Train both using best practices for stability (including learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping).

Hyperparameter Optimization:
Explore various settings (like model dimensions, attention heads, and sequence length) to identify configurations that yield the best prediction results.

Comprehensive Evaluation:
Assess model performance using advanced forecasting metrics—such as MASE and WAPE—besides standard scores like RMSE and MAE. This ensures results are meaningful for real forecasting scenarios.

Detailed Reporting:
Document the entire project: dataset creation, architectural choices, hyperparameter tuning process, model comparisons, and reasons for design selections. Reflect on training behavior and model stability.

Importance
This project offers a strong, practical foundation for applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in forecasting tasks—an essential skill in finance, engineering, and data science. Successfully addressing feedback and following best practices ensures your work matches industry expectations and prepares you for advanced roles in predictive analytics.​​
